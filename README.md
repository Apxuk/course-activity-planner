Tool for instructors to plan course activities and synchronize the data with syllabus, LMS, etc.

Moodle courses can be cloned and updated with new activity dates from a calendar. [Why?](https://github.com/fuhrmanator/course-activity-planner/blob/master/ooad/overview.md)


## How to use

### General principle

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dHamm1nw_N9n5JWKxLVGg7bBtb9BFCVm34DDo_D0WVc/pub?w=472&h=492)

Moodle activities can be planned relative to Seminars, Practica and Laboratories. Each activity adapts its start and end dates with the calendar of specific dates.

`<activity to plan> <start at activity> <end at activity>`

Ex: `Quiz 1 is opened on Seminar 1 and closed right before Practicum 2` would be possible with this line: `Q1 S1 P2`

* `MQ1` stands for Moodle Quiz 1
* `S1` stands for Seminar 1
* `P2` stands for Practicum 2

Generic activites which are not linked to Moodle content can also be created.

By default, Quizzes and Exams can be planned without any Moodle file.

### Start/End of activities

Adding `F` to an activity will read the finishing time of the activity. Adding nothing or `S` will read the start time.

Ex: `Quiz 1 is opened right after Seminar 1 and closed right after Practicum 1` would be `Q1 S1F P1F`


### Relative date or time modifiers

Amounts of time can be subtracted or added to activities.

Supports `+` or `-` combined with

* minutes: `m`
* hours: `h`
* days: `d`
* weeks: `w`

Ex: `1 hour after Seminar 1` would be `S1+1h`.

Ex: `15 minutes before Practicum 2` would be `P2-15m`.

Ex: `Quiz 1 is opened 1 hour after Seminar 1 and closed 15 minutes before Practicum 2` would be `Q1 S1+1h P2-15m`


### Absolute time modifier

The exact hours can be set to an activity.

Ex: `the day of Seminar 1 at 23:55` would be `S1@23:55`.

This can be used along with relative date or time modifiers.

Ex: `the day before Seminar 1 at 23:55` would be `S1-1d@23:55`.

**Please Note** when used with a relative modifier, the time modifier must be last.

`S1-1d@23:55` is valid

`S1@23:55-1d` is invalid

### Defining new activities

Activities can be configured by the administrator. Please refer to examples in `python/config/activities`.

## Development setup
* Create a google application with Identity Toolkit API access. Create an oauth2 client as a web application and save the client id. This id needs to be put in config/.

* Setup a python virtualenv
```
cd python && virtualenv-3.4 env
```
* Activate the python virtualenv
```
. env/bin/activate
```
* Install pip dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run it
```
./course_activity_planner.py
```
* Install bower dependencies
```
cd .. && bower install
```


### Run unit tests
* Run the test suite
```
nosetests
```
* Optionally, you can get a coverage report
```
nosetests --with-coverage
```

### Run the linter
```
pep8 && flake8
```

## Production setup
Please see deploy/README.md
